HelpingHand is an open-source social app/platform where you make friends by helping them. This was built for the purpose of submission to [HarperDB + Hashnode Hackathon 2021](https://townhall.hashnode.com/announcing-harperdb-hackathon-on-hashnode). The hackathon ran for the whole month of June '21, the submission was done with only 6 days of working both on the frontend and backend.

## CONTRIBUTING

I haven't found the time to continue on with the development of the web app however, 
it's open source, so you can jump in and help with the development if you want to.
